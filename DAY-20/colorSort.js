/*
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

        temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return arr;
}

console.log(sortColor([2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0])); // [0,0,1,1,2,2]
console.log(sortColor([2, 0, 1])); //[0,1,2]
